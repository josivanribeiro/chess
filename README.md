# Chess React App

# Overview
Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered game board
with 64 squares/cells arranged in an 8x8 grid. The Chess React App works using the Knight
piece. A knight can move either 2 squares horizontally and 1 square vertically OR 2 squares
vertically and 1 square horizontally.

# Organization & Architecture
The Chess React App solution is organized into two applications. The first, called "chessApi", which is a Node.js back-end application that provides a RESTful API service for calculating Knight positions on the board. The second application, called "chessfrt", is a React front-end application that provides the board interface, containing the cells that will be used to emulate the knight's movements.
